"""SQLite lock-contention helpers shared by the LCM engine.

Isolated from ``engine.py`` (WS5 seam): lock-contention detection, bounded
``busy_timeout`` changes, and transaction-preserving savepoints are pure SQLite
concerns with no engine state. Callers keep their own policy constants (for
example the session-end timeout budget).
